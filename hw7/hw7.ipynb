        "My experience with this assignment has been very positive. I think the assignment was surprisingly easier and more enjoyable than the previous one. I think the main reason is that since I already knew how to set everything up, I didn't have to worry about simply adding data to the database. My only complaint is how tedious the assignment was since there was a lot of data to be added but, I think it was very helpful nonetheless since there was a variety of ways we were adding it between sections. Overall, I actually learned a lot. I think this was the assignment I needed to finally understand databases and SQL better. I feel a lot better now about the project after this!"
